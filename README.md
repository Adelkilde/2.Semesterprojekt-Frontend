# 🌼 Gyldmark 🌼

### Our second semester project.

## 📃 Overview

Welcome to Gyldmark! This project is a comprehensive platform dedicated to managing and showcasing the works of the esteemed Danish author, Caroline Storgaard Gyldmark. It serves as a digital hub, providing detailed information about herself, as an author, and her literary works.

The platform is built using Vite and React, two powerful technologies that ensure a smooth and responsive user experience. Vite provides a faster and leaner development build, while React allows for efficient and reusable components. This combination allows us to create a robust and dynamic web application.

In addition to providing information, Gyldmark also aims to foster a community of readers and fans. Users can engage with each other, share their thoughts on the author's works, and stay updated on her latest publications and events.
